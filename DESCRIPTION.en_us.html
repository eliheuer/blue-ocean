<p>Blue Ocean is a fork of the typeface <a href="https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/bluu/">VTF Bluu Next</a> by Jean-Baptiste Morizot, now with an expanded weight range redrawn in quadratic curves by Eli Heuer. The quadratic curve drawing style gives the font a smooth phototypesetting-like quality.</p>

<p>The Blue Ocean project is led by <a href="https://elih.blog/">Eli Heuer</a>, a type designer based in Seattle, WA. Pull requests and new issues are welcome.
